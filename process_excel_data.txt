I am a part of these 2 audits.Could you please share your ideas and insights on the following areas:

•	Data Analytics: identifying areas where we can effectively apply DA to enhance our audit testing. 
•	Automated Control Testing: areas where we can streamline our control testing procedures through automation.
•	Advanced Testing Approaches: any testing strategies that could provide deeper insights or improve efficiency.

1. Post Quantum Cryptography Audit
Objective
Quantum computing poses a growing risk to current cryptographic systems expected to emerge withing 10 years. This audit will assess the organization's readiness and strategy to transition to quantum-resilient security.

In addition, the related cryptographic services will be reviewed:
- Key Management and Encryption
- Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- Tokenization
- De-Centralized Cryptography Governance

Justification of Audit
Thematic audit of the organization readiness and strategy to transition to quantum-resilient security, also covering the related cryptographic services.

2. Insider Threat Audit
Objective
The audit will focus on key controls relating to insider threat risk originating from within an organization, involving individuals with legitimate access to misuse and harm our organization's information systems and data. In addition, the audit will cover Fusion program which aims to collaboration between cyber, fraud, financial crime, insider threat & physical to detect and mitigate cross-domain risks.

Justification of Audit
Thematic audit of the end-to-end Insider Threat process and Fusion program which aims to collaboration between cyber, fraud, financial crime, insider threat & physical to detect and mitigate cross-domain risks.
