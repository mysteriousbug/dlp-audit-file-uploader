Access Management - Process Description, Risks, Controls, and Key Questions
PROCESS DESCRIPTION: DATABASE ACCESS MANAGEMENT
Database Access Management is a comprehensive process that governs how users obtain, maintain, and lose access to database systems across the organization. This process encompasses five database products (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, MongoDB, and DB2) across production and non-production environments in both GDC East (Hong Kong) and GDC West locations.
The process includes the following key lifecycle stages:
Access Provisioning: Users submit access requests through a formal request system with business justification. Requests go through a multi-level approval workflow involving managers, data owners, and security teams based on the sensitivity and privilege level requested. Once approved, access is provisioned by the DBA team or IAM team according to a documented access matrix that defines standard roles and privileges for each database product. All access follows the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum necessary permissions required for job functions.
Privileged Access Management: Privileged accounts, including DBA accounts and break-glass emergency accounts, are managed through specialized controls. Interactive privileged credentials are stored in OneVault, a privileged access management solution where users must check-out credentials with a Change Request reference, triggering alerts to designated personnel (currently Harish). Non-interactive service account credentials are stored in HashiCorp vault with automated rotation. The PID team conducts monthly workflow approvals through the PSRM team to validate privileged IDs. Multi-factor authentication is enforced, and privileged sessions are recorded for audit purposes.
Access Reviews and Recertification: Periodic access reviews are conducted to validate that users still require their current level of access. The frequency varies based on account type - quarterly for privileged users and semi-annually for standard users. Managers, data owners, or application owners conduct these reviews and identify inappropriate access for remediation. Service accounts and technical IDs are included in the review scope to prevent accumulation of orphaned credentials.
Access Revocation: When employees are terminated or change roles, their database access must be promptly revoked or adjusted. The process relies on notifications from HR systems to trigger timely deprovisioning. Dormant accounts that have been inactive for extended periods are identified and disabled to reduce the attack surface.
Monitoring and Change Detection: Database activity is monitored through comprehensive audit logging that captures authentication events, privilege changes, data access, and configuration modifications. The Change Management team, headed by Januar, conducts monthly reviews of audit logs to identify unauthorized changes made without approved Change Requests. Real-time alerting is configured for high-risk events such as privilege escalation, failed authentication attempts, and access to sensitive data.
Data Protection: Sensitive data, particularly personally identifiable information (PII), is protected through multiple layers including encryption at rest, encryption in transit via SSL/TLS, and data masking. The DASH process, managed by the application team, masks PII data so that database administrators cannot view it in clear text. Application-level encryption provides additional protection for highly sensitive data elements.
Requestor Authorization: Not all organizational groups are authorized to request database access. A formally approved list of authorized requestor groups defines which teams and departments may submit access requests based on their business functions and legitimate need for database access.
This end-to-end process is governed by policies, supported by automated tools and manual procedures, and monitored through various detective controls to ensure appropriate access is maintained while preventing unauthorized access to sensitive database systems and data.
RISK 1: EXCESSIVE OR INAPPROPRIATE ACCESS PRIVILEGES
Risk Title: Users Granted Excessive Privileges Beyond Job Requirements
Risk Description: Users may be granted database access privileges that exceed what is necessary to perform their job functions, violating the principle of least privilege. This can occur when access is not properly aligned with the access matrix, when approvers grant broader permissions than requested or justified, when users accumulate privileges over time without review (privilege creep), or when service accounts are granted administrative privileges unnecessarily. Excessive privileges increase the risk of unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, fraud, accidental data corruption, insider threats, and compliance violations. For example, a data analyst requiring read-only access to specific tables might be granted write access to entire schemas, or a developer might receive production database access when only non-production access is needed. Service accounts running automated processes might be granted DBA-level privileges when limited permissions would suffice. This risk is particularly acute when there is no documented access matrix to serve as a baseline, or when the provisioning process does not validate requested access against approved roles.
Mapped Control Title: Access Matrix Definition and Least Privilege Enforcement
Control Description: A formally documented and approved access matrix exists for each of the five database products (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, MongoDB, DB2) defining standard roles and their associated privileges. This access matrix serves as the authoritative baseline for what privileges should be granted to users based on their job functions and business requirements. The matrix is maintained by the Database Governance Team and reviewed at least annually to ensure it remains current with business needs and security requirements. When access is provisioned, the access provisioning team validates that the requested privileges align with the access matrix and the principle of least privilege. Users are granted only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their job duties. Role-based access control is utilized where feasible, with users assigned to pre-defined roles rather than receiving custom privilege grants. The access matrix includes clear documentation of what each role can do, which schemas or tables it can access, and what types of operations are permitted (read-only, read-write, administrative). For privileged access requests such as DBA roles, additional scrutiny is applied including security team review and documented business justification. The provisioning process includes verification that provisioned access matches the approved request and access matrix before accounts are enabled.

RISK 2: ACCESS GRANTED WITHOUT PROPER APPROVAL
Risk Title: Database Access Granted Without Adequate Business Justification or Appropriate Approvals
Risk Description: Database access may be granted without following proper approval workflows, obtaining necessary business justification, or securing approvals from appropriate authorities. This can occur when the access request workflow has gaps or is bypassed, when approvers rubber-stamp requests without proper review, when emergency access is granted verbally without documentation, or when DBAs provision access based on informal requests without tickets. Inadequate approval processes result in unauthorized individuals obtaining database access, sensitive data being exposed to those without legitimate need-to-know, compliance violations with regulatory requirements that mandate documented approvals, inability to demonstrate proper authorization during audits, and lack of accountability for access decisions. For example, a contractor might request and receive production database access without approval from the data owner or security team, or a developer might obtain privileged access based solely on their manager's approval without additional scrutiny. This risk is heightened when there is no clear definition of who should approve different types of access requests, when the approval workflow can be circumvented, or when approvals are not retained as audit evidence.
Mapped Control Title: Access Request and Approval Workflow with Multi-Level Authorization
Control Description: A formal access request and approval workflow is enforced for all database access provisioning. All access requests must be submitted through the designated system (ServiceNow, JIRA, or equivalent ticketing system) and include mandatory fields: requester identification, business justification, specific database and privileges requested, duration of access (permanent or temporary), and proposed approvers. The approval workflow varies based on the type and sensitivity of access being requested. Standard user access requires manager approval to confirm business need and job role alignment. Access to databases containing sensitive data (PII, financial information, customer data) requires additional approval from the data owner who has responsibility for that information. Privileged access requests (DBA roles, administrative privileges, ability to grant access to others) require security team review and approval in addition to management approval. Cross-department access requests where users request access to databases outside their normal business area require enhanced scrutiny and data owner approval. The workflow enforces segregation of duties such that requestors cannot approve their own access requests. All approvals must include acknowledgment of the specific privileges being granted and confirmation of business necessity. The access provisioning team verifies that all required approvals are obtained before provisioning access, and the provisioning action is documented in the request ticket. Emergency access may be granted through an expedited process but must be followed by formal approval and documentation within 24-48 hours. All access request tickets with approval trails are retained as audit evidence for the required retention period.

RISK 3: DEVELOPERS WITH PRODUCTION DATABASE ACCESS
Risk Title: Segregation of Duties Violation - Developers Having Production Database Access
Risk Description: Application developers may be granted access to production databases, creating a segregation of duties violation and increasing risks of unauthorized changes, data corruption, and fraud. Developers typically require database access in development and testing environments to build and validate applications, but production access creates concerning scenarios where the same individuals who write code can also modify production data or configurations directly. This risk manifests when developers request production access citing operational needs, when access provisioning doesn't distinguish between production and non-production environments, when developers transition to support roles and retain development privileges, or when exception processes are used routinely rather than rarely. The consequences include unauthorized production changes bypassing change management, developers making direct data modifications to "fix" issues without proper oversight, ability to hide application bugs by manipulating data, fraud opportunities where developers can both create transactions and cover them up, compliance violations of segregation of duties requirements, and inability to maintain clear separation between development and production environments. For instance, a developer with production access might modify customer account balances to resolve a bug rather than fixing the underlying code issue, or might access production customer data for testing purposes. This risk is particularly severe in regulated industries (financial services, healthcare) where segregation of duties is a compliance requirement.
Mapped Control Title: Developer Production Access Restriction with Exception Management
Control Description: A policy explicitly prohibits application developers from having access to production databases except through formally approved exceptions with compensating controls. The access request workflow includes automated controls that identify users with developer job roles and prevent provisioning of production database access to these individuals. Access to production databases is restricted to authorized operational support teams, database administrators, and specific application support personnel who require it for their job functions. When business circumstances require a developer to have temporary production access (for example, troubleshooting a critical production issue that cannot be replicated elsewhere), a formal exception process must be followed. Exceptions require senior management approval, documented business justification, time-bound access that automatically expires, and compensating controls such as enhanced monitoring of the developer's production activity and potentially requiring a second person to be present during production access sessions. The exception approval must specify the exact duration and scope of production access needed. Access provisioning teams validate that users requesting production access are not in developer roles, and any exceptions are flagged for additional scrutiny during access reviews. Periodic analytics are performed to identify any developers who may have obtained production access inappropriately. Developers are provided with production-like environments (pre-production, UAT) that contain sanitized data for troubleshooting and testing purposes, reducing the legitimate need for production access.

Do you perform periodic analytics to identify any developers who may have inadvertently been granted production access?
What segregation of duties controls exist between those who develop applications and those who manage production databases?
RISK 4: SERVICE ACCOUNTS WITH EXCESSIVE PRIVILEGES
Risk Title: Service Accounts Granted DBA or Administrative Privileges Unnecessarily
Risk Description: Service accounts and application IDs that are used for automated processes and application-to-database authentication may be granted excessive privileges, including DBA or SUPERUSER roles, when more limited permissions would be sufficient for their functional requirements. Service accounts are particularly risky when over-privileged because they operate without human oversight, often have static credentials with infrequent rotation, may be shared across multiple applications or servers, and their activities can be harder to audit since they generate high volumes of automated transactions. The risk occurs when service accounts are granted administrative privileges for convenience rather than necessity, when privilege requirements are not properly analyzed during application deployment, when service accounts inherit excessive permissions from templates, or when "one size fits all" approaches grant all service accounts broad access. Consequences include automated processes having ability to drop tables or databases accidentally, compromised service accounts providing attackers with administrative database access, malicious code running with excessive privileges if an application is compromised, inability to implement least privilege for automated processes, compliance violations, and difficulty in auditing service account activities due to lack of granularity. For example, an application that only needs to read and write specific tables might be given a service account with DBA privileges, or a monitoring tool that needs read-only access might be granted full administrative rights.
Mapped Control Title: Service Account Privilege Restriction and Accountability
Control Description: Service accounts are subject to the same least privilege principle as human user accounts, with access limited to the minimum necessary for their functional purpose. When new service accounts are requested, the requester must document the specific database operations the service account needs to perform (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on specific objects) and provide technical justification. Service accounts are generally prohibited from having DBA, SUPERUSER, or administrative privileges unless there is compelling technical justification and approval from both the application owner and database security team. Each service account must have a documented owner - a specific individual who is accountable for that account, responsible for requesting and justifying its access, and responsible for notifying IAM when the service account is no longer needed. Service accounts are included in periodic access reviews where their continued need and appropriateness of privileges are validated. Service account credentials are never hard-coded in application configuration files but must be retrieved from HashiCorp vault or equivalent secrets management solution. Credentials are rotated on a regular schedule (for example, every 90 days) through automated processes. Monitoring is configured to detect unusual service account activity, such as interactive logins (service accounts should only be used non-interactively), access from unexpected source IPs or hosts, or activity patterns that deviate from established baselines. Service accounts are clearly identifiable through naming conventions and are tagged in identity management systems to facilitate reporting and oversight. Any service account found to have excessive privileges during access reviews must have privileges right-sized or provide updated justification.

Can you demonstrate how you would provision a new service account and what validation occurs to ensure it's not granted excessive privileges?
RISK 5: SHARED OR GENERIC DBA CREDENTIALS
Risk Title: Lack of Individual Accountability Due to Shared Privileged Accounts
Risk Description: Database administrator accounts may be shared among multiple individuals or use generic naming conventions rather than being tied to specific named users, eliminating individual accountability for privileged actions. Shared DBA credentials represent one of the most critical access management risks because they make it impossible to determine which specific person performed sensitive database operations, prevent effective investigation of security incidents or unauthorized changes, undermine non-repudiation principles, enable password sharing that spreads credentials beyond controlled channels, complicate access revocation when individuals leave or change roles, and violate regulatory requirements in many frameworks. This risk manifests when DBA teams use accounts like "dba_admin," "oracle_dba," "sa," or "postgres" that multiple team members know the password to, when credentials are written down or stored in shared documents, when team members share credentials verbally or via messaging, or when password rotation requires coordinating with multiple people. Consequences include inability to determine who made unauthorized changes or accessed sensitive data, difficulty in forensic investigations since audit logs show only the shared account name, passwords becoming widely known as team members share them, terminated DBAs potentially retaining knowledge of passwords if not rotated, compliance audit findings and regulatory penalties, and loss of detective control effectiveness since privileged activity cannot be attributed to individuals. For example, if unauthorized privilege escalation is detected on a shared "dba" account, it's impossible to determine which of five DBAs who know that password performed the action.
Mapped Control Title: Individual Named DBA Accounts with Privileged Access Management
Control Description: All database administrator and privileged accounts must be individually named and tied to specific persons, following naming conventions that clearly identify the account owner (for example, "firstname.lastname_dba" or similar). Shared, generic, or group accounts are prohibited for human users. Each DBA must have their own individual account with appropriate privileges for their role. This ensures that all privileged database activities can be traced to specific individuals through audit logs. Privileged credentials for these individual accounts are managed through OneVault, a privileged access management solution where passwords are vaulted and not known to individual users. When a DBA needs to access a database, they authenticate to OneVault (with multi-factor authentication), request checkout of specific database credentials with a Change Request reference number providing business justification, and receive time-limited session credentials. An alert is automatically sent to a designated oversight person (currently Harish) when privileged credentials are withdrawn from the vault, creating a notification trail. The original credentials remain in the vault and are not disclosed to the user. This check-out process creates an audit trail of who accessed which privileged account and when. Privileged sessions are recorded, providing additional forensic evidence of what actions each individual performed. The vault enforces password rotation policies without requiring individual users to know or change passwords manually. When a DBA leaves the organization or changes roles, their access to withdraw credentials from OneVault is revoked, immediately eliminating their ability to access privileged accounts regardless of any password knowledge they may have previously had. Break-glass emergency accounts are clearly identified in OneVault and are subject to the same individual access controls with enhanced alerting due to their high privilege levels.

RISK 6: PRIVILEGED CREDENTIALS NOT VAULTED
Risk Title: DBA and Privileged Account Credentials Not Managed Through Privileged Access Management Solution
Risk Description: Privileged database credentials including DBA passwords, administrator account credentials, service account passwords, and break-glass emergency account credentials may not be stored in a privileged access management (PAM) solution such as OneVault or HashiCorp, resulting in passwords being known to individuals, shared insecurely, written down, stored in password managers, or embedded in scripts and configuration files. When privileged credentials are not vaulted, they are subject to numerous security weaknesses including individuals knowing and potentially sharing passwords, passwords remaining static for extended periods without rotation, no audit trail of who accessed which credentials when, passwords being stored in insecure locations like spreadsheets or sticky notes, credentials being exposed if individual devices are compromised, inability to immediately revoke access when someone leaves since they retain password knowledge, and no alerting when privileged credentials are accessed. The risk is compounded when multiple credential types across different database products are managed inconsistently, when there is no central repository for privileged credentials, when emergency access credentials are stored unsecurely "just in case," or when service account credentials are hard-coded in application code or configuration files that may be stored in code repositories accessible to many developers. Consequences include privileged credentials being compromised through phishing or social engineering, terminated employees retaining access capability, credentials being shared beyond intended individuals, inability to demonstrate proper credential management during audits, regulatory compliance violations, and fundamentally weak privileged access security posture.
Mapped Control Title: Comprehensive Privileged Credential Vaulting in OneVault and HashiCorp
Control Description: All database privileged credentials are required to be stored in appropriate vaulting solutions based on their usage pattern. Interactive privileged accounts used by human DBAs are stored in OneVault with a check-out/check-in workflow. Users authenticate to OneVault with multi-factor authentication, request specific credentials with business justification and Change Request reference, and receive time-limited session credentials without seeing or knowing the actual password. The vault automatically generates alerts to designated oversight personnel (currently Harish) when credentials are withdrawn. Non-interactive service account credentials used for application-to-database authentication are stored in HashiCorp vault where applications retrieve credentials programmatically at runtime without credentials being embedded in code or configuration files. Both vaulting solutions enforce automated password rotation on defined schedules (for example, every 90 days for service accounts) without requiring manual intervention or knowledge of the passwords by individuals. The vaults maintain complete audit logs of all credential access including who requested credentials, when, for what purpose (CR reference), and what actions were taken during the session. Break-glass emergency accounts are specifically identified within OneVault and tagged for enhanced monitoring due to their high-privilege nature and emergency-only intended use. The PID (Privileged ID) team maintains governance over vaulted credentials through a monthly workflow where the PSRM team reviews and approves privileged IDs, ensuring only authorized accounts are vaulted and that vaulted accounts are still required. Vault access itself is strictly controlled with only authorized administrators able to modify vault configurations or reset credentials. Technical controls prevent provisioning of new privileged database accounts unless corresponding vault entries are created, ensuring no privileged accounts exist outside the vaulting infrastructure. Coverage metrics are monitored to ensure 100% of privileged credentials are vaulted with immediate remediation if gaps are identified.

How do you measure vault coverage to ensure all privileged accounts are vaulted? Do you have metrics showing coverage percentage?
What happens if someone tries to create a new privileged database account without a corresponding vault entry? Are there technical controls to prevent this?
RISK 7: NO MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION FOR PRIVILEGED ACCESS
Risk Title: Privileged Database Access Not Protected by Multi-Factor Authentication
Risk Description: Database administrator and other privileged accounts may not require multi-factor authentication (MFA), relying solely on username and password for authentication, leaving these high-value accounts vulnerable to compromise through various attack vectors. Single-factor authentication for privileged access is inadequate because it's susceptible to credential theft through phishing attacks that trick users into revealing passwords, brute force attacks that guess weak passwords, credential stuffing using passwords leaked from other breaches, keylogging malware that captures passwords as they're typed, shoulder surfing or social engineering to obtain passwords, and password reuse where users employ the same password across multiple systems. Without MFA, a compromised privileged password provides an attacker immediate and complete access to databases with no additional barrier. The risk is heightened for remote access scenarios, access from untrusted networks, privileged accounts that haven't changed passwords recently, and accounts with standing privileges rather than just-in-time access. Consequences of compromised privileged accounts include unauthorized access to sensitive production data, data exfiltration or ransomware attacks, unauthorized privilege escalation creating additional compromised accounts, malicious configuration changes that create backdoors, compliance violations of frameworks requiring MFA for privileged access, and inability to detect that access is from an unauthorized person since credentials are valid.
Mapped Control Title: Multi-Factor Authentication Enforcement for All Privileged Database Access
Control Description: Multi-factor authentication is mandatory for all access to privileged database accounts including DBA roles, administrative accounts, and break-glass emergency accounts. MFA is enforced at the point of authentication to the privileged access management solution (OneVault) rather than at database level, providing centralized control and consistent user experience. When a user authenticates to OneVault to withdraw database credentials, they must provide something they know (password or PIN) plus something they have (such as a time-based one-time password from a mobile authenticator app, hardware token, smart card, or biometric factor). The MFA solution supports multiple factor types to accommodate different user scenarios and provides backup authentication methods in case primary methods are unavailable. MFA is required for each session - users cannot authenticate once and maintain prolonged access without re-authentication. The MFA policy is technically enforced and cannot be disabled or bypassed by individual users or even by most administrators. Security metrics track MFA enrollment rates for privileged users (target is 100%) and flag any privileged accounts that are not enrolled. MFA is also enforced for access to the vault administration interfaces, ensuring that even those who manage the PAM solution itself must use multi-factor authentication. In the rare scenario where MFA is temporarily unavailable due to technical issues, a documented exception process requires senior security approval and enhanced compensating controls such as restricting access to only business-critical activities, increased session monitoring, and mandatory review of all activities taken during the MFA exception period.

RISK 8: PRIVILEGED SESSIONS NOT RECORDED
Risk Title: Lack of Privileged Session Recording Prevents Forensic Investigation and Accountability
Risk Description: Privileged database sessions where DBAs and administrators perform high-risk activities such as configuration changes, privilege grants, data modifications, or schema changes may not be recorded, eliminating the ability to forensically investigate what specific actions were taken, verify that changes were authorized and performed correctly, detect malicious insider activity, or maintain accountability for privileged operations. Without session recording, organizations must rely solely on database audit logs which capture what SQL commands were executed but not the full context of sessions including what the user viewed, what commands they typed but didn't execute, or what troubleshooting steps they performed. Session recordings provide video-like evidence of exactly what occurred during a privileged session, including screen content, keystrokes, commands executed, results returned, and timing information. The risk of not recording privileged sessions includes inability to investigate security incidents involving privileged accounts, no evidence of what a malicious insider did or accessed, difficulty in troubleshooting changes that caused problems, inability to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements for privileged activity monitoring, no deterrent effect of knowing sessions are recorded, and inability to use recordings for training or knowledge transfer purposes. This risk is heightened for privileged actions taken during off-hours, for changes that later prove to have been unauthorized or erroneous, for privileged access during security incidents, and when investigating potential insider threats where the subject may have covered their tracks by manipulating audit logs.
Mapped Control Title: Mandatory Privileged Session Recording and Retention
Control Description: All privileged database sessions are recorded through the privileged access management solution when users withdraw credentials from OneVault and establish database connections. Session recordings capture the complete user session including all commands executed, output received, screen content viewed, and timing information, creating a video-like replay capability for forensic purposes. Recordings are stored in a secure, tamper-evident repository separate from the databases themselves, preventing privileged users from deleting or modifying their own session recordings. Retention periods for session recordings align with regulatory requirements and are typically maintained for at least one year or longer depending on the sensitivity of the databases accessed and applicable compliance frameworks. Access to session recordings is restricted to authorized security personnel, auditors, and designated management with a legitimate need to review them for investigations, compliance, or training purposes. Access to recordings is itself logged to create an audit trail of who reviewed which sessions and when. Session recordings are indexed and searchable by various attributes such as user identity, database accessed, date/time range, duration, and specific commands executed, facilitating efficient investigation and review. In the event of a security incident, unauthorized change, data breach, or suspicious activity, session recordings provide critical forensic evidence of exactly what occurred. Recordings are also used proactively during periodic quality reviews where a sample of privileged sessions is reviewed to ensure DBAs are following procedures and security practices. The existence and regular use of session recording serves as a deterrent to malicious insider activity since privileged users know their actions are being captured. Technical controls prevent DBAs from disabling session recording for their own sessions, and any failures in the recording system trigger alerts to security teams.
