key questions:

1. check if access matrix - is properly defined or not
check all ids, all privileges
if privileges are assigned appropriately

task: map build account to privileges

2. database samples - 
verify what id/roles for users have access to db, what privileges do they have

3. pid vaulting
for all ids from task 2, check if these are vaulted in onevault/hashicorp

4. DAM process + unauth change process
ask if there are audit trail logs for the DAM process

5. verify if all requestor groups for db access are legit/appropriate


other notes:
1. PID team - monthly - workflow - approvals - PSRM team ID
2. in onevault when an id is withdrawn (id:password is a key value pair) - alert is sent to harish - cr reference given by harish - session managed id is sent to the user
non interactive database- hashicorp
interactive database - onevault
3. change management team is responsible to identify unauth changes. a monthly review happens in this team. this team is head by januar
4. app level encryption env ready
encryption at rest
at db
5. break glass accounts in one vault - can be identified against account names
these accounts have high/medium privileges
6. pii data not visible to database team - it is masked by - app team - via dash process
