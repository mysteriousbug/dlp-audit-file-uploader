i want to include these questions

1. explain the access management process end to end
2. can you show me how access is configured (in any one db class among PostgreSQL, DB2, MongoDB, MSSQL, Oracle DB)
3. can i get a list of all db owned ids?
4. is there a report/document available for access management?
5. can you tell me more about unauthorized privilege escalation? how do you identify unauth changes?
6. are there access controls to restrict access to sensitive information? what tool are you using to monitor database activity?

also you can include any more questions regarding access management if you need it
