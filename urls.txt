# MyVoice 2025 Presentation - Complete Speaker Notes

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE

**Speaker Notes:**

Good morning/afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining today's session.

Today we're presenting the progress and initial findings from our MyVoice 2025 initiative. This isn't just another survey presentation - it's about having an honest conversation about where we are, what we're hearing from you, and most importantly, what we're going to do about it.

I want to set the tone upfront: we're committed to transparency. You'll hear both the positive feedback and the difficult truths. And you'll see concrete action plans with names and deadlines attached - not just acknowledgments, but real commitments.

Let's dive in.

---

## SLIDE 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Speaker Notes:**

Let me give you the headline numbers first. We're 64% through the interview process - 74 conversations completed out of 116 total. That's strong participation and we're on track to finish by the end of October.

Now, what are we hearing? It's a mixed picture. On the positive side, our culture and flexibility remain strong points. People genuinely value working here and appreciate the colleagues they work with. That's our foundation.

But - and this is the important part - we're seeing critical concerns around workload and career progression. These aren't minor issues. They're showing up in almost every conversation, and they're affecting people's ability to sustain their commitment here.

Here's what happens next: We complete remaining interviews this month, analyze everything thoroughly, share full findings with you by November 15th, and launch action plans in December. This timeline is non-negotiable. We're not going to sit on this data.

The key message I want you to take from this slide: we're listening, we're moving quickly, and we're committed to action.

## SLIDE 3: OUR APPROACH

**Speaker Notes:**

Let me quickly walk you through how we built this year's questionnaire, because understanding our approach helps you understand why we're confident in the findings.

We started with questions and themes from 2023 and 2024. We didn't reinvent the wheel - we wanted to track trends over time. Then we consulted with the GIAI My Voice team to understand what worked and what didn't in previous years.

The big addition this year is a new theme on Future Readiness, specifically around AI and technology changes. Given everything happening in our industry, we felt it was critical to understand how you're feeling about these changes and what support you need.

This gave us 11 questions across 5 themes. Let me highlight these themes because they'll come up throughout the presentation:

First, your experience working with SCB and GIAI - what motivates you, what concerns you have.

Second, work environment - this covers workload, work-life balance, stress levels, and how comfortable you feel speaking up.

Third, growth and promotion - training, career progression, performance evaluation.

Fourth, your relationship with your People Leader - communication, support, feedback quality.

And fifth, that new one - future readiness around AI and technology.

The format is confidential one-on-one interviews, about 30 minutes each. Why interviews instead of anonymous surveys? Because we wanted to hear the full story, not just check boxes. The depth of insight we're getting is significantly richer than what a survey would provide.

## SLIDE 4: PARTICIPATION UPDATE

**Speaker Notes:**

Let's talk about where we are in the process. As of October 17th, we've completed 74 of 116 interviews - that's 63.8%. 

[Point to pie chart] The blue represents completed interviews, orange is what remains. We have 42 more conversations to finish this month.

Now let me share the timeline because I want you to know exactly when you'll hear back from us. Between now and October 31st, we're finishing the remaining interviews. November 1st through 7th, we're doing comprehensive analysis - looking for patterns, themes, connecting the dots. November 8th to 14th, leadership sits down with these findings and develops action plans with specific owners and deadlines.

November 15th is the key date - that's when we share everything with you. Full findings, action plans, commitments. Not a sanitized version, the real picture.

Then December hits and we start implementing. We're not waiting until next year. The priority actions begin immediately.

And January, we give you the first progress report. You'll see what's been accomplished, what's in flight, what's delayed and why, and any adjustments we're making.

One thing I want to emphasize - we're targeting 100% participation. Every voice matters. If you haven't been scheduled yet, you'll be hearing from us soon. If you need to reschedule, no problem, just let us know. We want to talk to every single person.

---

## SLIDE 5: EARLY INSIGHTS OVERVIEW

**Speaker Notes:**

Now we get to the substance. What are we actually hearing? Remember, this is based on 74 conversations, so these are preliminary themes, but they're already very clear and consistent.

Let me start with the positives - the strengths we need to sustain.

Our inclusive culture is strong. 85% of responses about culture were positive. People describe leaders as approachable, feel safe voicing opinions and admitting mistakes. Multiple people said "good culture" is why they stay. This is huge. Culture is hard to build and easy to destroy. We need to protect this.

Flexibility also scores well at 75% positive. The hybrid work arrangements are valued. People appreciate that we trust them to manage their schedules. However - and here's the first warning sign - this flexibility is increasingly insufficient to balance the workload. It's masking an underlying problem.

Now the areas requiring attention. Work-life balance is getting mixed feedback. It's manageable for most, but fatigue is increasing. Burnout is creeping up, especially during audit planning and reporting periods. We need better workload distribution.

Team connection is interesting - 94% feel connected, which is good. But there's a desire for more. More face-to-face engagement, more follow-through on feedback. Some people mentioned feeling disconnected with the Gravity structure changes.

Now the critical concerns. These two showed up in 100% of conversations. Every single person raised these issues.

Workload and planning. Heavy workload, back-to-back audits with no breathing room. A clash between Country and Group audits putting people in the middle. Limited downtime. And here's the technical piece - insufficient auditor days allocated for detailed audit work. People are being asked to do comprehensive audits without adequate time allocation.

Career progression. People feel stagnant. Their workload has increased but progression opportunities haven't. There's insufficient recognition for effort. Evaluation criteria are perceived as inconsistent across People Leaders. And there's a desire for clearer expectations and coaching.

Look at those percentages at the bottom. These aren't representing positive sentiment - they represent how many people raised each concern. 100% on workload and career means everyone is talking about these issues.

This slide should make us uncomfortable. It should create urgency. Because good culture and flexibility aren't enough if people are burning out and feel their careers are stuck.

---

## SLIDE 6: DETAILED THEME ANALYSIS

**Speaker Notes:**

Let me walk you through each theme in more detail. This is where we see the nuance.

Theme 1: Experience with SCB and GIAI. The positives are real - pride in working for SCB, quality colleagues, meaningful work, good exposure. But the concerns are also real - unclear career pathways, recognition limited to major projects while daily contributions go unnoticed, desire for involvement in strategic discussions.

Theme 2: Work Environment. Again, mixed. Flexibility valued, leaders approachable, safe to voice opinions. But overwhelming workload, back-to-back audits, Country and Group conflicts, insufficient auditor days, increasing fatigue and burnout. The negatives are drowning out the positives here.

Theme 3: Growth and Promotion. Available training is decent quality. But career feels stagnant, unclear promotion criteria, evaluation lacks transparency and consistency, no protected time for learning, recognition insufficient. People want to grow but don't see the path.

Theme 4: People Leader Engagement. Leaders are approachable. But people want more - more regular check-ins, clearer expectations, better coaching on priorities, more follow-through, better workload support. The relationship is okay but not where it needs to be.

Theme 5: Future Readiness. This one is concerning. Some curiosity about AI exists. But mostly anxiety - job security worries, lack of clear communication about impact, insufficient training, fear of being left behind technologically. We're creating fear instead of excitement about change.

The pattern here is clear. We have a good foundation - culture, people, meaningful work. But operational pressures and lack of clarity on progression are undermining everything else.

---

## SLIDE 7: CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Speaker Notes:**

I'm going to be very direct here. These are the three issues that require immediate action. Not next quarter, not next year. Now.

Priority 1: Workload and Burnout Crisis. This is the number one issue. 100% of people raised workload concerns. Back-to-back audits, minimal recovery time, Country and Group schedules clashing, insufficient auditor days. People are exhausted.

What's the risk if we don't act? Team burnout, health issues, work quality suffering, people leaving. And it won't be the low performers who leave - it'll be the high performers who have options elsewhere.

Why it matters - and this is critical - no amount of flexibility or good culture compensates for unsustainable workload. You can't flexibility your way out of a volume problem.

Priority 2: Career Stagnation and Recognition Gap. Again, 100% raised concerns. Workload increased but progression opportunities haven't. Evaluation criteria inconsistent. Hard work unrecognized. No clear path forward.

Risk? We lose high performers. Motivation drops. People feel effort doesn't matter. Difficulty attracting new talent because word gets out.

Why it matters? People need to see a future here. If they can't, they'll look elsewhere. It's that simple.

Priority 3: Work-Life Balance Deteriorating. Flexibility isn't sufficient anymore. Regular overtime and weekend work becoming normalized. Burnout increasing during peak periods. Personal lives suffering.

Risk? Health and wellbeing issues. Decreased productivity. Relationship strain. Long-term sustainability concerns. People can't sprint a marathon.

Why it matters? We're asking people to maintain an unsustainable pace. Something has to give, and usually what gives is either their health or their employment here.

Here's the bottom line - if we do nothing, expect continued morale decline, stress-related absences, and departures of key team members. These issues won't fix themselves. They'll get worse.

I know this is uncomfortable. It should be. Because our people are telling us they need help, and we need to respond.

---

## SLIDE 8: IN THEIR OWN WORDS

**Speaker Notes:**

I want you to hear directly from your colleagues. These are anonymous quotes from the interviews.

On workload: "I love the work and the team, but I'm running on empty. There's no breathing room between audits."

"We keep flagging that we need more auditor days, but nothing changes. Then we're blamed for not going deep enough."

"Country audits and Group audits clash constantly. We're caught in the middle with impossible expectations from both sides."

These aren't complaints for the sake of complaining. These are people describing an unsustainable situation.

On career progression: "My workload has doubled in two years, but my title and pay haven't changed. What's my path forward?"

"I don't know what I need to do to get promoted. The criteria seem to change depending on who you ask."

"I see colleagues with similar performance getting different ratings. It feels arbitrary."

That last one should concern us. If the evaluation process feels arbitrary, it undermines trust in the entire system.

On work-life balance: "The flexibility is great, but it doesn't make up for being constantly overwhelmed. I'm just working from home instead of the office."

"I feel guilty taking leave because I know the work will pile up and someone else will have to cover."

"My family keeps asking when I'll be less busy. I don't know what to tell them anymore."

Think about that. People can't answer their families when things will get better.

But here's what gives me hope - listen to these: "The team culture is genuinely good. People help each other and leaders are approachable."

"I'm proud to work here and the work itself is meaningful. I just wish the conditions were more sustainable."

These aren't disengaged people. These are committed team members who want to succeed here. They're asking for help. That's very different from people who've checked out.

The message is clear: Fix the operational issues and you'll retain engaged, committed people. Ignore them, and you'll lose your best performers.

---

## SLIDE 9: YEAR-ON-YEAR TRENDS

**Speaker Notes:**

Now let me show you why urgency is so critical. This slide compares 2023, 2024, and 2025 data.

Work-life balance: 65% satisfied in 2023, dropped to 58% in 2024, now 42% in 2025. That's a 23 percentage point drop in two years. This isn't a blip. It's a trend, and it's accelerating.

Career satisfaction: 70% in 2023, 65% in 2024, 40% in 2025. A 30 percentage point drop. Three years ago, most people were satisfied with career prospects. Now most aren't.

The one bright spot - culture and inclusion: 80% in 2023, 82% in 2024, 85% in 2025. It's improving. That's the good news. Our foundation is getting stronger.

Flexibility: Slight decline from 85% to 80% to 75%. Still good, but trending down.

Workload manageability: This is alarming. 55% found it manageable in 2023, 48% in 2024, only 33% in 2025. Two-thirds of people now find the workload unmanageable.

Here's the key insight from this slide: Culture is improving, but operational pressures are overwhelming the positives. It's like building a beautiful house while the foundation is cracking. The structure might look good, but it's not sustainable.

The trends are clear. We're heading in the wrong direction on the issues that drive retention. Culture alone won't keep people here if they're burned out and see no career future.

The positive spin is: we're catching this now, while culture is still strong. We have a window to fix operational issues before we damage the culture too. But that window is closing.

---

## SLIDE 10: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**Speaker Notes:**

I want to spend time here because understanding why these issues exist is critical to solving them properly. Quick fixes won't work if we don't address root causes.

Workload crisis - why is this happening? 

Structurally, audit scope increased without proportional resources. We're doing more with the same number of people. Country and Group audits aren't coordinated - schedules conflict, putting auditors in impossible positions. Insufficient auditor days built into planning from the start. No buffer time between engagements.

Process-wise, last-minute scope changes and urgent requests disrupt planning. Everything becomes urgent, so nothing is actually urgent. Limited junior resource support or delegation opportunities.

Career stagnation - root causes:

System issues: Promotion criteria unclear and inconsistently applied across People Leaders. What gets you promoted in one team might not in another. Limited visibility into opportunities. No formal career pathing conversations built into the process. Evaluation standards vary by People Leader.

Communication issues: Expectations not clearly defined upfront. Feedback too infrequent and not specific enough. Recognition focused on major projects, daily contributions invisible. People don't know where they stand until the annual review.

Work-life balance - root causes:

Volume issues: Workload increased faster than capacity. Flexibility masks the volume problem - people can work from home but they're still working too much. Peer pressure and guilt about leaving on time.

Cultural issues: Overtime and weekend work becoming normalized instead of exception. "Always on" expectations via email and messaging. Recognition for long hours rather than efficiency - wrong incentives.

Here's why this slide matters: These aren't perception problems that we can fix with better communication. These are real operational and systemic issues requiring structural solutions.

You can't communicate your way out of insufficient auditor days. You can't send an email that fixes inconsistent evaluation criteria. You need to change the actual systems and processes.

That's what our action plans will address.

## SLIDE 11: PROPOSED ACTIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY

**Speaker Notes:**

This is the most important slide in the deck. Everything up to now was diagnosis. This is the prescription. And I want you to notice something about this slide - every action has an owner, a deliverable, and a deadline. This isn't aspirational. These are commitments.

Let me walk through the immediate actions - things happening in the next 30 days.

Action 1: Workload Capacity Review. [Insert name] is leading a comprehensive review of audit schedules, auditor days, and resource allocation. Deliverable is a report with specific rebalancing recommendations. Deadline: November 20th. Three weeks from now, we'll have a data-driven plan for addressing workload.

Action 2: Evaluation Criteria Clarification. [Insert name] is documenting clear, consistent evaluation criteria for all levels. No more guessing what gets you promoted. It'll be written down and shared with everyone. Deadline: November 30th.

Action 3: Country-Group Audit Coordination. [Insert names] from both Country and Group audit teams are establishing a coordination protocol to prevent schedule conflicts. New scheduling process implemented by November 25th. No more putting auditors in impossible situations.

Short-term actions - next 90 days:

Action 4: Career Pathway Framework. Creating clear progression pathways with timelines and requirements. Every role will have a defined next step and what's needed to get there. Includes individual pathway discussions with each person. December 31st deadline.

Action 5: People Leader Calibration Sessions. Monthly meetings to ensure consistency in evaluations and expectations across all People Leaders. No more inconsistency. First session December 15th, then ongoing monthly.

Action 6: Protected Learning Time Policy. Establishing minimum monthly learning hours that are actually protected in schedules. Not just encouraged - protected. Policy documented and communicated, calendar time blocked. January 15th.

Action 7: Workload Rebalancing Plan. Based on the capacity review, implementing specific rebalancing actions. Adjusted schedules with buffer time built in. January 31st implementation.

Medium-term initiatives - six months:

Action 8: Recognition Program Enhancement. Implementing regular recognition for daily contributions, not just major projects. New framework and monthly practices by March.

Action 9: Work-Life Balance Guidelines. Clear expectations around working hours, email response times, weekend work. Written guidelines and leadership commitment to model them. February.

Action 10: AI Readiness Program. Comprehensive training on AI impact, tools, skill development. Addressing the anxiety head-on. Training curriculum launched, all staff enrolled by April.

Action 11: Enhanced Check-in Framework. Structure and frequency requirements for meaningful People Leader check-ins. New framework with topics, frequency, documentation. March.

Now here's the accountability mechanism. Monthly leadership review of all actions. Transparent reporting - updates shared with full team monthly. Adjustment process - we'll modify what's not working. Direct feedback - you can flag if commitments aren't being met.

I'm going to be very clear: We are committing to these actions publicly. These aren't things we hope to do. These are things we will do. And we'll report progress transparently. If we miss a deadline, you'll know why and what the new timeline is.

This level of specificity and transparency is intentional. We want you to hold us accountable.

---

## SLIDE 12: MEASURING OUR PROGRESS

**Speaker Notes:**

Commitments without measurement are just wishes. So let me explain exactly how we're going to track whether we're making real progress.

Monthly pulse checks on the top 3 issues. Quick survey - workload, career satisfaction, work-life balance. Five questions, takes two minutes. Results shared with the team within a week. This isn't an annual thing. We're checking in monthly.

We're also tracking leading indicators. Overtime hours - are they going up or down? Leave utilization rates - are people actually taking time off? Schedule conflicts - are Country and Group audits still clashing? Career conversations - are People Leaders having them?

These leading indicators tell us if our actions are working before the annual survey.

Quarterly reviews every three months. Transparent report on all action items. What's complete, what's in progress, what's delayed and why. Team feedback session to course-correct. Because if something's not working, we need to know and adjust.

We're rotating focus areas quarterly: Q1 2026 focuses on workload and capacity. Q2 on career progression and recognition. Q3 on work-life balance and wellbeing. Q4 on learning, development, and future readiness. This ensures sustained attention on each area.

Mid-year in June, comprehensive review of all 2025 MyVoice action items. Detailed assessment. Team survey on progress and impact. Adjustments based on learnings. Renewed commitments where needed.

Then full MyVoice 2026 in October. Same questions to track movement. Year-over-year comparison. Assessment of trend reversals. Celebration of wins. Identification of persistent or new issues.

Here's what will tell you we're serious: More realistic schedules with buffer time. Clear career criteria published and consistently applied. Regular recognition for contributions. Protected learning time actually protected. Leadership modeling healthy work-life boundaries. Monthly updates showing tangible progress.

Success means seeing those trends we showed earlier reverse. Work-life balance satisfaction going up instead of down. Career satisfaction increasing. Workload becoming more manageable.

And you feeling the difference in daily work life. That's the ultimate measure.

---

## SLIDE 13: OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU

**Speaker Notes:**

I want to take a moment to be very explicit about what you can expect from leadership going forward.

We commit to transparency. Sharing all findings honestly, including difficult truths. Reporting progress regularly, not just once a year. Acknowledging when we fall short. No sugarcoating, no hiding bad news.

We commit to action. Addressing critical issues with urgency, not just words. Assigning clear ownership and deadlines to every commitment. Making tough decisions to fix systemic problems. Because some of these fixes require hard choices about resource allocation, priorities, and how we operate.

We commit to accountability. Tracking progress publicly and transparently. Welcoming feedback when commitments aren't being met. Course-correcting quickly based on what we learn. If something's not working, we'll change it.

We commit to partnership. This isn't done TO you, it's done WITH you. Your ongoing feedback shapes our actions. We succeed or fail together.

Now here's what we ask from you.

Honesty. Continue sharing candid feedback. Flag issues early, not just in annual surveys. Tell us when actions aren't working. We can't fix what we don't know about.

Patience with progress. Some changes take time to implement properly. Quick fixes often don't solve root causes. Sustainable change requires a systematic approach. But patience doesn't mean passivity - keep holding us accountable.

Engagement. Participate in pulse checks and feedback sessions. Contribute ideas for solutions - you know the work better than anyone. Support each other through the changes.

One thing I want to emphasize: This is not just a survey. It's a conversation that continues year-round. It's a commitment to build a better workplace together. It's a demonstration that your voice genuinely matters and drives real change.

The old model was: survey once a year, share sanitized results, make vague commitments, repeat next year. That's done. The new model is: ongoing dialogue, transparent findings, specific actions, visible progress, continuous improvement.

---

## SLIDE 14: NEXT STEPS AND TIMELINE

**Speaker Notes:**

Let me be very specific about what happens from here so there's no ambiguity.

October 18-31: We finish the remaining 42 interviews. If you haven't been scheduled, you will be this week. Every voice needs to be heard.

November 1-7: Analysis and synthesis. We review all 116 interview responses. Look for patterns. Prioritize themes. Develop detailed findings report.

November 8-14: Action planning with leadership. We present findings to the leadership team. Develop specific action plans with owners. Finalize commitments and timelines. Prepare communication materials.

November 15: This is the key date. Town hall presentation of findings. Full transparency. Q&A session with leadership - bring your tough questions. Written summary shared with everyone. Open dialogue about concerns and solutions.

December: Implementation begins. We launch immediate priority actions. First monthly pulse check happens. Short-term initiatives kick off. Tracking mechanisms established.

January: First progress report. Update on all action items. Share early wins and challenges. Adjust approach based on learnings. Reinforce commitment to change.

Then ongoing through 2026: Monthly pulse checks and updates. Quarterly comprehensive reviews. Mid-year assessment in June. Full MyVoice 2026 in October.

Your role in all of this: Stay engaged. Share feedback. Hold us accountable. Help shape the solutions.

The timeline is aggressive intentionally. We're not going to study this for six months. We're moving quickly because the issues are urgent.

---

## SLIDE 15: THANK YOU

**Speaker Notes:**

I want to close with gratitude and a call to action.

Thank you to the 74 colleagues who have already shared their experiences. Your candor is helping us understand reality and build a better workplace. Every conversation matters and contributes to meaningful change.

Your feedback is heard. We've listened carefully to every word. Your feedback is valued. Your insights are guiding our priorities. Your feedback is acted upon. We're committing to concrete actions with accountability.

The conversation continues. This isn't the end - it's the beginning of ongoing dialogue. We'll keep listening throughout the year, not just once annually. Your feedback shapes our actions, and our actions aim to improve your experience.

If you have questions or concerns, please reach out. Contact the MyVoice Team. [Insert contact name, email, phone/Teams info]. We welcome your thoughts, questions, and ongoing feedback at any time. Don't wait for the next survey. If something's not working, tell us.

Together, we build a workplace where everyone can thrive.

Before we open for questions, I want to leave you with this: The issues we've discussed today are serious. They require urgent attention. But I'm optimistic because of two things.

First, the foundation is strong. Our culture is good and improving. People care about the work and each other. That's huge and it gives us something to build on.

Second, you haven't given up. You're still here, sharing feedback, wanting things to improve. That tells me you still believe this can be a great place to work. And that belief, combined with genuine action from leadership, is how we fix this.

The next few months will tell the story. Will we do what we said we'd do? Will the actions make a real difference? Will we see the trends reverse?

I'm committed to making sure the answer is yes. And I ask for your partnership in making it happen.

Now, let's open it up for questions. And please, don't hold back. Tough questions are welcome.

---

## ANTICIPATED Q&A - PREPARATION NOTES

**Q: "We've heard commitments before. Why should we believe this time is different?"**

A: Fair question and I understand the skepticism. Here's what's different: First, the level of specificity. We're not saying "we'll work on workload" - we're saying [Name] will complete a capacity review by November 20th with specific recommendations. Second, public accountability. We're sharing these commitments with everyone and reporting monthly on progress. Third, consequences. If we don't deliver, you'll see it in the tracking, and it'll be discussed in quarterly reviews. Leadership's credibility is on the line. This isn't a survey report filed away somewhere. It's a public commitment we'll be held to.

**Q: "The workload issue has been raised before. Why hasn't it been fixed?"**

A: Honestly? Because we've tried to work around it instead of addressing the root cause. We've added flexibility, encouraged time management, told People Leaders to be supportive. But none of that fixes insufficient auditor days or conflicting Country-Group schedules. We've been treating symptoms instead of the disease. This time we're doing structural fixes - actually changing how we allocate auditor days, how we coordinate schedules, how we plan capacity. That's the difference.

**Q: "How can you promise career progression when there are limited senior positions?"**

A: Great question. Career progression doesn't only mean promotion to next level. It means clarity on: What skills do I need to develop? What projects give me visibility? What's the realistic timeline? What are alternative paths like specialist tracks? We can't promise everyone becomes a VP, but we can promise everyone knows what good looks like, gets fair evaluation, sees development opportunities, and has regular career conversations. The issue isn't lack of promotions - it's lack of clarity and inconsistency.

**Q: "What if the action plans don't work?"**

A: Then we adjust them. That's why we're measuring monthly. If something's not moving the needle after three months, we'll try something different. The commitment isn't to specific tactics - it's to solving the problems. We'll be transparent about what's working and what's not. And we'll keep iterating until we get it right. The alternative - doing nothing - isn't acceptable.

**Q: "Who's accountable if deadlines are missed?"**

A: The named owners for each action are accountable. And ultimately, leadership is accountable for the overall program. If we miss deadlines, we'll explain why publicly and provide new timelines. Repeated misses without good reason is a performance issue for the owner. We're not going to let this slide.

**Q: "This seems like a lot of actions. How do we know you won't get overwhelmed and nothing happens?"**

A: Valid concern. That's why we phased them - immediate actions in 30 days, short-term in 90 days, medium-term in 6 months. We're not trying to do everything simultaneously. Also why we assigned specific owners - distributed accountability. And why we're tracking monthly - to catch if things are slipping. But you're right to call out the risk. If we find we've overcommitted, we'll prioritize the top 3-5 and be transparent about that.

**Q: "What about people who already left because of these issues?"**

A: We can't undo their departures, which is unfortunate because we clearly lost good people. What we can do is fix the issues so we don't lose more. And create a workplace worth recommending to talented people we want to attract. The best tribute to colleagues who left is to fix the problems they raised so current and future team members don't face the same issues.

**Q: "Will this affect our performance reviews or ratings?"**

A: No. This is about improving the organization, not individual performance evaluation. Your participation and feedback won't negatively affect you. In fact, the goal is to make performance reviews more fair and consistent through this process. But individual conversations and reviews are separate from this organizational feedback.

**Q: "What if my specific concern wasn't addressed in these themes?"**

A: The themes represent the most common issues across all interviews. If you raised something specific that didn't make the top themes, it doesn't mean it's not important. It's captured in the detailed analysis. And you can always raise it directly with your People Leader or HR. The themes help us address systemic issues, but individual concerns still matter.

## CLOSING REMARKS (AFTER Q&A)

**Speaker Notes:**

Thank you all for your questions and your engagement today. The discussion we've had reinforces what we heard in interviews - you care about this place and want it to improve.

A few final thoughts as we wrap up:

The findings we shared today might have been uncomfortable. They should be. Because they represent real pain points for real people. But discomfort is the first step toward change.

The actions we've committed to are ambitious. Intentionally so. Because incremental tweaks won't reverse the trends we're seeing. We need meaningful, structural change.

The timeline is aggressive. Because your patience has limits and the urgency is real. We're not going to study these issues for another six months while problems persist.

Your ongoing participation matters. Keep sharing feedback. Participate in pulse checks. Hold us accountable. Challenge us when actions aren't working. Because this only succeeds if it's a partnership.

Between now and November 15th when we share full findings, a few things will happen. Remaining interviews will be completed. Deep analysis will be done. Action plans will be finalized. And we'll be preparing for a comprehensive discussion with the full team.

I encourage you to talk about today's session with your teammates. Process what you heard. Think about what you want to see in the full findings presentation. Prepare questions for November 15th.

And most importantly, don't lose hope. Yes, we have serious issues. But we also have strong culture, committed people, and leadership willing to make changes. That combination is powerful.

Thank you again for your time, your feedback, and your commitment to making GIAI the best it can be.

We'll see you at the full findings presentation on November 15th. Until then, stay engaged.

END OF SPEAKER NOTES
