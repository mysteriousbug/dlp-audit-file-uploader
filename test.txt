just to give you the latest update: we have finished all the interviews (100%).
my colleague is doing the intro, team details, demographics, questionnaire and theme approach slide. i dont have to worry about that.
i am doing the interview results and action items slide (2 slides). i have put my slide contents here:

slide 1: interview responses

1. experience of working with the bank
2. work environment
3. future readiness
4. growth and promotion
5. people leader

under each section i have listed the positives and negatives. i liked the 'Now we get to the substance. What are we actually hearing? Remember, this is based on 74 conversations, so these are preliminary themes, but they're already very clear and consistent.

Let me start with the positives - the strengths we need to sustain.

Our inclusive culture is strong. 85% of responses about culture were positive. People describe leaders as approachable, feel safe voicing opinions and admitting mistakes. Multiple people said "good culture" is why they stay. This is huge. Culture is hard to build and easy to destroy. We need to protect this.

Flexibility also scores well at 75% positive. The hybrid work arrangements are valued. People appreciate that we trust them to manage their schedules. However - and here's the first warning sign - this flexibility is increasingly insufficient to balance the workload. It's masking an underlying problem.

Now the areas requiring attention. Work-life balance is getting mixed feedback. It's manageable for most, but fatigue is increasing. Burnout is creeping up, especially during audit planning and reporting periods. We need better workload distribution.

Team connection is interesting - 94% feel connected, which is good. But there's a desire for more. More face-to-face engagement, more follow-through on feedback. Some people mentioned feeling disconnected with the Gravity structure changes.

Now the critical concerns. These two showed up in 100% of conversations. Every single person raised these issues.

Workload and planning. Heavy workload, back-to-back audits with no breathing room. A clash between Country and Group audits putting people in the middle. Limited downtime. And here's the technical piece - insufficient auditor days allocated for detailed audit work. People are being asked to do comprehensive audits without adequate time allocation.

Career progression. People feel stagnant. Their workload has increased but progression opportunities haven't. There's insufficient recognition for effort. Evaluation criteria are perceived as inconsistent across People Leaders. And there's a desire for clearer expectations and coaching.

Look at those percentages at the bottom. These aren't representing positive sentiment - they represent how many people raised each concern. 100% on workload and career means everyone is talking about these issues.

This slide should make us uncomfortable. It should create urgency. Because good culture and flexibility aren't enough if people are burning out and feel their careers are stuck.
'. retain this.

slide 2: suggested actions and ideas

1. experience of working with the bank
Audit scheduling to avoid overlapping bookings and consider recovery time between bookings
Strengthen onboarding and resource planning for new joiners
Standardize methodology and clarify Country vs Group ownership to reduce duplication

2. work environment
Reinforce psychological safety; eliminate blame and defensive reactions
Increase informal team interactions and cross-location connection (team lunch meeting place holders are sent out every month - nobody ever follows through)
Recognize teamwork and collaboration; not only output quantity
Include downtime after heavy cycles

3. future readiness
Protect dedicated learning time in audit calendar
Build structured capability building pathways for AI, data and domain skills
Focus training on audit-relevant use cases and link to development plans

4. growth and promotion
Publish transparent and standardized promotion/evaluation criteria
Schedule formal career-development discussions frequently
Introduce mentorship and targeted domain-expertise refresh programs

5. people leader
Empower PLs to manage workload and resource constraints
Create trackers for feedback outcomes and actions taken
Require monthly 1:1s focused on well-being and development
Foster the culture of coaching and accountability instead of blame
Standardize feedback quality across PLs


for my content, i want a script in text. i dont want to read out the ppt as is. keep the funny bits like diagnosis and prescription like you gave in your previous response.
