Deliverables	What went well?	What could have been better?
"1. DLP Audit:
- Test data creation
- Streamlit app for file upload/download
- Automated URL testing
- FTP server setup and data exfiltration
- AWS app for file upload/download
2. TPSA Audit: 
- Build a Python script to perform data analysis with 99.5% accuracy to identify 103 SLA violations 
- Build a complex automation for validating the entire population with 70% time reduction, where the 33,400 TPIDs with 160 variables - 
- Manual Control Mapping: 56 TPSA controls mapped to NIST, ISF, CIS, MCL frameworks
3. Post Quantum Cryptography Audit: Prepared a technical presentation on Quantum
4. IPM Audit: Build a Python script to perfom DA for Incident Caused by Change
5. New GDCE Env Ops Audit - DA for Subnet/IP mapping
6. My Voice 2025 - Team Lead"	"- Delivered all audit assignments on time and within scope
- Exceeded quality standards with 99.5% accuracy in TPSA analysis and 99.8% in ISRR calculations
- Demonstrated professional skepticism by validating automated results against existing data and documenting discrepancies
- Collaborated effectively with audit team members"	"- Could have requested more frequent check-ins during complex projects to ensure continuous alignment
- Should have documented lessons learned immediately after each deliverable rather than retrospectively "
"- Used ML to recognize problematic themes across feedbacks received in the My Voice Survey
- Developed Python automation scripts for Audit Automation
- AI-powered mapping tool for framework alignment"	"- Successfully automated a sizable portion of testing tasks
- Introduced AI/ML capabilities to assigned tasks through control mapping and sentiment analysis tools
- Created scalable solution that handle 10x data volumes (10,000+ TPIDs vs current 1,437)"	Could have established automated testing pipelines for script validation
"- Knowledge sharing through Quantum Cryptography workshop to management and team
- Continuous learning:"		
"- Technical expertise: Build reputation as ""go-to person"" for Python automation and cloud tools

- Community engagement: Delivered green computing masterclass to African students as a part of Employee Volunteering Activity (external to SC) "	"- Demonstrated use of emerging technologies (quantum cryptography, AI/ML) relevant to banking's future
- Built trusted relationships with audit leads through reliable delivery and transparent communication"
