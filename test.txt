if interim isrr is low and volume is <100, final isrr is isrr-1
if interim isrr is low and data format is hardcopy, then final isrr is isrr-1
if interim isrr is low and system connectivity is privileged database access, final isrr is isrr+1

if interim isrr is moderate and volume is <100, then final isrr is isrr-1
if interim isrr is moderate and data format is hardcopy, then final isrr is isrr-1
if interim isrr is moderate and system connectivity is privileged database access, then final isrr is isrr+1

if interim isrr is high and volume <50 then final isrr is isrr-1
if interim isrr is high and data format is hardcopy then final isrr is isrr-1
if interim isrr is high and system connectivity is privileged database access then final isrr is isrr+1

if interim isrr is critical and volume <10 then final isrr is isrr-1
if interim isrr is critical and data format is hardcopy then final isrr is isrr-1

for all other scenarios interim isrr==final isrr
