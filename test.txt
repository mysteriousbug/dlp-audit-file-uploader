Here's your revised speaking script with a more respectful tone for senior leadership:
SLIDE 1: INTERVIEW RESPONSES - SPEAKING SCRIPT
[Transition from colleague's intro]
Thank you [colleague's name]. So let me pick up from here with what our colleagues have shared with us.
I'm pleased to report that we've completed all 116 interviews - 100% participation. Every voice was heard. So what I'm sharing today isn't preliminary or partial. This is the complete picture from across our team.
Let me frame how I'll present this. I'll walk through each of the five themes, and for each one, I'll share the positives first - what's working well that we should sustain - followed by the areas of concern. Some of this feedback may be difficult to hear, but it reflects the genuine experiences of our colleagues and deserves our full attention.
[THEME 1: EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH THE BANK]
Let's start with our colleagues' experience working at the bank and with GIAI.
On the positive side, there's genuine pride in working for SCB. Our colleagues value the quality of their peers, the collaborative environment, and the meaningfulness of the work. Several colleagues mentioned "I'm proud to tell others I work here." This kind of authentic pride is something we should recognize and preserve - it's a reflection of the strong foundation we've built.
The areas of concern? Career pathways need greater clarity. Our colleagues want to understand what their next step looks like and how to get there. There's also a desire for more recognition of day-to-day contributions, not just major projects. And some expressed interest in being more involved in strategic discussions - contributing to shaping direction, not just executing it.
[THEME 2: WORK ENVIRONMENT]
Work environment revealed a complex picture - significant strengths alongside serious challenges.
The positives are substantial. Our inclusive culture is strong. Leaders are described as approachable. Our colleagues feel safe voicing opinions and admitting mistakes. Several mentioned "good culture is why I stay." This is genuinely valuable. Culture of this quality takes years to build and can be fragile. It's one of our most important assets.
Flexibility also scores well. The hybrid work arrangements are valued. Our colleagues appreciate the trust placed in them to manage their schedules.
However - and this is an important observation - the feedback suggests that this flexibility is increasingly insufficient to balance the workload. It may be masking a more fundamental challenge. In essence, colleagues are saying "We appreciate being able to work from home, but we're still overwhelmed."
Now the areas requiring urgent attention.
Workload appeared in nearly every conversation. Our colleagues described heavy workloads, back-to-back audits with minimal recovery time, and a clash between Country and Group audits that creates conflicting expectations. There's limited downtime between major engagements. And critically - insufficient auditor days allocated for detailed audit work. Our colleagues are being asked to conduct comprehensive audits without adequate time allocation, then receiving feedback that the work wasn't deep enough. This creates an untenable situation.
Work-life balance received mixed feedback. While manageable for some, fatigue is increasing across the team. Burnout is becoming more prevalent, especially during audit planning and reporting periods. What's particularly concerning is that colleagues report feeling guilty about taking leave because they know work will accumulate or burden their peers.
Let me share one quote that was particularly striking: "My family keeps asking when I'll be less busy. I don't know what to tell them anymore." This suggests the current pace may not be sustainable.
[THEME 3: FUTURE READINESS]
Future readiness, particularly around AI and technology, revealed an interesting dynamic.
The positive aspect? There's genuine curiosity. Our colleagues want to understand AI and see its potential. That intellectual curiosity is an asset we can build upon.
However, the concerns are substantial. There's significant anxiety about job security and skill relevance. Our colleagues are concerned about being left behind technologically. One colleague articulated it as: "Show us how AI makes our jobs better, not why we're replaceable." This captures the type of conversation we need to facilitate.
There's also feedback that AI is being implemented without adequate training or clear communication about impact. The perception is that change is being done to our colleagues rather than with them. This creates apprehension instead of engagement.
[THEME 4: GROWTH AND PROMOTION]
Growth and promotion is where we see the most pronounced frustration in the feedback.
On the positive side, where training is available, our colleagues generally find it of decent quality. That's a foundation we can strengthen.
But several challenges emerged. Our colleagues feel career progression has stagnated. Workload has increased but advancement opportunities haven't kept pace. Evaluation criteria are perceived as inconsistent across People Leaders - what leads to progression in one team may not in another. Recognition feels insufficient. And critically - there's no protected time for learning during work hours. We're encouraging development while work demands make it practically impossible to engage in learning activities.
One colleague put it directly: "My workload has doubled in two years, but my title and pay haven't changed. What's my path forward?" This is a question we need to be able to answer clearly.
[THEME 5: PEOPLE LEADER]
Finally, People Leader engagement.
The positive: Our colleagues generally view their leaders as approachable. There isn't a perception that managers are difficult or unapproachable. That's an important baseline.
The concerns center on frequency and quality of engagement. Our colleagues want more regular, meaningful check-ins. Greater clarity on expectations. Better coaching on priorities and workload management. More follow-through on feedback - not just soliciting input, but demonstrating what happens with it.
Communication is perceived as too infrequent, and when it occurs, often feels rushed and transactional rather than developmental. Some colleagues don't feel comfortable sharing personal challenges because past experiences suggested it might negatively impact perceptions of their capability.
One colleague described it as: "My PL asks 'how are you?' but doesn't really want an honest answer."
[OVERALL MESSAGE]
Let me synthesize what we're hearing across these five themes.
We have genuinely strong foundations. Good culture, meaningful work, high-quality colleagues, authentic pride in the organization. These are significant assets.
However - and this is the critical observation - operational pressures appear to be overwhelming these positives. Workload is approaching unsustainable levels. Career progression lacks clarity. Work-life balance is deteriorating. And we're generating anxiety rather than excitement about the future.
What's particularly important to recognize: Strong culture and flexibility, while valuable, may not be sufficient if our colleagues are experiencing burnout and career stagnation. These operational challenges require operational solutions.
This feedback should create a sense of urgency. We have engaged, committed colleagues who want to succeed here. They haven't disengaged - they're actively seeking help and clarity. That's a very different situation, and it means we have an opportunity to address these challenges while we still have that engagement.
However, the feedback suggests this window may be time-limited.
[Pause, then transition]
So... what might we consider doing about this? That's what the next slide addresses.
SLIDE 2: SUGGESTED ACTIONS AND IDEAS - SPEAKING SCRIPT
[Opening]
So that was the diagnosis. Now let me present some potential prescriptions.
I want to highlight that these are specific, actionable ideas we've developed based on the feedback, organized by the same five themes. Some could be implemented relatively quickly. Others would require more planning and resources. But all of them are concrete suggestions for your consideration.
Let me walk through each theme.
[THEME 1: EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH THE BANK]
For experience of working with the bank and GIAI.
First, improving audit scheduling to avoid overlapping bookings and building in recovery time between major audits. Currently, colleagues are transitioning from one intense audit directly into another with no buffer. This impacts both sustainability and work quality.
Second, strengthening onboarding and resource planning for new joiners. More structured onboarding would help set new colleagues up for success from the start.
Third, standardizing methodology and clarifying Country versus Group ownership to reduce duplication. Currently, some colleagues feel caught between conflicting expectations. Greater clarity about ownership would help reduce this tension.
[THEME 2: WORK ENVIRONMENT]
For work environment.
First, reinforcing psychological safety by eliminating blame and defensive reactions. Creating an environment where colleagues feel safe admitting mistakes or asking for help prevents issues from being hidden until they escalate.
Second, increasing informal team interactions and cross-location connections. I should note that we currently send out team lunch meeting placeholders monthly, but participation has been very low. If we believe these interactions are valuable, we might need to approach them differently to encourage actual attendance.
Third, recognizing teamwork and collaboration, not only output quantity. This would signal that how work is accomplished matters, not just volume of output.
Fourth, building in downtime after heavy cycles. Scheduling recovery time after intensive audit periods would support sustainability and quality.
[THEME 3: FUTURE READINESS]
For future readiness, particularly around AI.
First, protecting dedicated learning time in the audit calendar. This would mean actually blocking time and respecting those blocks, rather than encouraging learning while making it practically impossible due to workload.
Second, building structured capability development pathways for AI, data, and domain skills. Our colleagues need a clear path from current capability to required capability, not just ad-hoc training offerings.
Third, focusing training on audit-relevant use cases and linking to development plans. Practical, directly applicable training would be more valuable than theoretical concepts. Colleagues need to understand specifically how AI will affect their audit work and what tools they'll be using.
[THEME 4: GROWTH AND PROMOTION]
For growth and promotion.
First, publishing transparent and standardized promotion and evaluation criteria. Written, public criteria would help our colleagues understand exactly what's required for progression and ensure consistency across the organization.
Second, scheduling formal career development discussions more frequently. Quarterly conversations, rather than only annual reviews, would make career development an ongoing dialogue rather than an annual event.
Third, introducing mentorship programs and targeted domain-expertise refresh programs. This would provide colleagues access to experienced peers for guidance and keep skills current in evolving areas.
[THEME 5: PEOPLE LEADER]
For People Leader engagement.
First, empowering PLs to manage workload and resource constraints. This would mean giving People Leaders actual authority to push back on unrealistic demands and redistribute work, not just asking them to support work-life balance without the tools to do so.
Second, creating trackers for feedback outcomes and actions taken. When colleagues raise issues, tracking what happens next creates accountability and demonstrates that feedback leads to action.
Third, requiring monthly one-on-ones focused on wellbeing and development. These would be substantive conversations about how colleagues are doing and where they want to grow, not just project status updates.
Fourth, fostering a culture of coaching and accountability rather than blame. When issues arise, the focus would be on learning rather than fault-finding. This approach develops capability rather than creating defensiveness.
Fifth, standardizing feedback quality across PLs. This would ensure all colleagues receive regular, specific, actionable feedback, not vague generalizations.
[CLOSING]
Now, I want to be clear about how to interpret this slide. These are ideas and suggested actions based on the feedback we received. Some could be quick wins we implement immediately. Others would require more planning and resources. And some may need adjustment based on practical realities and priorities.
What I would suggest is important: we need to respond with concrete action. Presenting these findings without following through with meaningful changes could significantly damage the trust and engagement we currently have with our colleagues.
The next steps would typically involve leadership reviewing these suggestions, determining priorities, assigning ownership, setting timelines, and committing to specific actions. Then communicating those commitments back to our colleagues - clearly, specifically, with accountability.
This isn't the conclusion of the process. It's the beginning of ongoing dialogue and action.
The core message from 116 interviews is clear: Our colleagues want to succeed here. They value the work and their peers. However, they need conditions that make sustained success possible. These suggested actions aim to help create those conditions.
The positive aspect is that we still have engaged colleagues who care deeply about their work. The foundation is strong. However, we have an opportunity to address these operational and systemic challenges while we have that engagement.
We appear to have a window of opportunity to address these concerns. The feedback suggests we should act thoughtfully but with appropriate urgency.
[Pause]
That concludes the presentation of our findings and suggested actions. I'm now opening the floor for any questions or discussion you'd like to have. Thank you for your attention and consideration of this feedback from our colleagues.
