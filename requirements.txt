I need to perform this test:
Incident Caused by Change
Objective: To identify inconsistencies in the reporting of disruption start time in the incident ticket by validating it against the relevant ticket of the change that caused the incident.
Scenario Testing: to validate the disruption start time recorded in the relevant change ticket against the recorded disruption start time in the incident ticket. 

I have these input files in .csv format. I am putting 1 record in each file to show you the format.
1.i1_i2_i3.csv

2.i4.csv - same as i1_i2_i3.csv
3.i5.csv - same as i1_i2_i3.csv

4.i1_i2_i3_extra.csv
number	impact	u_affected_country	caused_by

5.i4_i5_extra.csv
number	impact	u_affected_country	caused_by

6.change_i1.csv

8.change_i2.csv - same as change_i1.csv
7.change_i3.csv - same as change_i1.csv

i will have to join the entire incident table with the change table, then perform the test.
