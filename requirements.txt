i want you to look at this format:
Process Ref.	Process Title	Process Description	Risk Ref	Risk Title	Risk Description	Control Ref.	Control Title	Control Description	Related Key Questions	CDE Required	COE Required	CDE or COE DA Required	Control Design Effectiveness (CDE) - Test Procedures	Control Operating Effectiveness (COE) - Test Procedures	"Data Analytics (DA)
Test Procedure"	Audit Team Member

also note that the output should look like this (this is someone else's work, but note the format):
P-03	Database Backup and Restore	Database backup and restoration ensures data is securely copied, monitored and recoverable.	R-01	Inadequate database backup and restoration	Inadequate database backup and restoration may lead to prolonged downtime, data loss, and operational disruption.	CO3.0	Backup and Restore Management	"The Database team (WHO) configures and monitors databases backups and performs backup restoration (WHAT) on a periodic basis (WHEN) to ensure data integrity, availability and recoverability within defined RPO/RTO requirements (WHY).
Control attributes:
1. Defined backup and restoration requirements
2. Backup config and validation
3. Backup monitoring, alerting and remediation
4. Restoration results and remediation"


for my process 'access management', i want to write only 1 risk and 1 control. the risk should be something like this - 'Excessive or Inappropriate Access Privileges, and vaulting of privileged credentials'
i want these CDE's:
1. verify that access matrix is defined properly for any one database (test-of-one sample), and access matrix is reviewed regularly
2. one CDE for vaulting

i want these COE's:
1. Access Matrix Alignment (All 4 databases - DA on complete population) - Map user's role to access matrix for all database accounts
2. Privileged Credential Vaulting Coverage Validation
3. Verify that all groups who can request database access are legitimate, authorized, and appropriate based on their roles. (Service NOW - approver details) 

i want these DA. DA is same as COE, but with more sub steps:
1. Access Matrix Alignment(All 4 databases - DA on complete population)
1a. Test if majority users are PIDs. 
1b.Check if all defined PIDs are actually necessary (different PIDs with same privileges, in regular use/locked/unused for a long time, etc)

2. Privileged Credential Vaulting Coverage Validation gap analysis

3. Verify that all groups who can request database access are legitimate, authorized, and appropriate based on their roles. (Service NOW - approver details)
