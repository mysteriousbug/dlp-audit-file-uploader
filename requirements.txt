P-04 | Access Management | Access management ensures that database access privileges are appropriately granted, monitored, and secured through proper credential vaulting.
R-02 | Excessive or Inappropriate Access Privileges and Inadequate Vaulting of Privileged Credentials | Excessive or inappropriate access privileges and inadequate vaulting of privileged credentials may lead to unauthorized data access, security breaches, and compliance violations.
CO4.0 | Database Access and Credential Management | "The Database Security team (WHO) defines, reviews, and maintains access matrices and ensures privileged credentials are vaulted (WHAT) on a periodic basis (WHEN) to ensure appropriate access controls and secure credential storage are maintained (WHY).
Control attributes:
Defined and documented access matrix requirements
Regular access matrix review and validation
Privileged credential vaulting configuration and monitoring
Access request approval workflow validation"
Related Key Questions:
Is the access matrix properly defined and regularly reviewed?
Are all privileged credentials stored in the vault?
Are access approvers authorized and appropriate for their roles?
CDE Required: Yes
COE Required: Yes
CDE or COE DA Required: Yes
Control Design Effectiveness (CDE) - Test Procedures:
Verify that the access matrix is properly defined for one database (test-of-one sample) and validate that the access matrix undergoes regular documented reviews
Verify that privileged credential vaulting requirements and configurations are properly defined and documented
Control Operating Effectiveness (COE) - Test Procedures:
Access Matrix Alignment (All 4 databases - DA on complete population) - Map each user's role to the access matrix for all database accounts to verify alignment
Privileged Credential Vaulting Coverage Validation - Verify that all privileged credentials are stored in the vault with no gaps in coverage
Verify that all groups who can request database access are legitimate, authorized, and appropriate based on their roles (ServiceNow - approver details
