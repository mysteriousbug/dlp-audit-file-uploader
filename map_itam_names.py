involved & by ensuring the below:
• assigning unique IDs to Clients,
• defining and maintaining adequate policy for access credentials and issuing (to Clients) only credentials meeting the policy requirements,
• masking the password characters when they are being entered,
• encrypting passwords (including passphrases) and PINs at-rest (with strong encryption) and in-transit,
• all newly created Client IDs are enabled for access and enforce change of initial temporary password/PIN in accordance with applicable policy,
• ensuring that Client identification, authentication and authorisation in the Groups Technology Assets meets applicable regulatory requirements,
• assuring that only authorised Clients are permitted to have access,
• periodically enforcing Client related information review and update and assuring that Clients account Information is updated only when a Client has been authenticated successfully,
• protection against automated brute-force attacks, repeated logon attempts and concurrent logons,
• assuring that Client ID must be protected from unauthorised access and modification AND can’t be easily guessed or revealed from publicly know information,
• if required, periodical password/PIN change where issued for Client IDs (as per the predefined policy)
• restricting access only to Information based on 'Need to know' principle 
• SoD - TAM and security measures to ensure any password generated, re-issued, or reset by Group would not be disclosed or leaked during the generation and delivery process,
• configuring session idle timeout
• not displaying, storing and/or transmitting in clear text any passwords (including passphrases) or any PIN’s or any such Authentication values,
• not displaying any specific error or help messages that would facilitate an unauthorised access to succeed,
• notifying Clients of the date and time of their last successful login as well as failed login attempts,
• for OTP based authentication, the minimum character length of OTP and its validity period must be defined in accordance with risk anticipated from likelihood of the OTP guessing, brute-forcing or interception.
c) Client access arrangements including periodical review (as per applicable regulation or at least annually)
d) managing security incidents related to Client access.
[Note: Client access & transaction measures to consider fraud risk mitigation measures in accordance with Group Fraud Risk Policy.]
[Objective: Client access to systems is safely managed to mitigate the risk the access misuse.]
